SMS Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm ("His Majesty's Ship Elector Friedrich Wilhelm") was
 one of the first ocean-going battleships of the Imperial German Navy, the fourth 
pre-dreadnought of the Brandenburg class. She was laid down in 1890 in the Imperial 
Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven, launched in 1891, and completed in 1893 at a cost of 11.23 
million Marks. She served as the flagship of the Imperial fleet from her c
ommissioning until 1900, seeing limited active duty during the relatively peaceful late 
19th and early 20th centuries. Her career focused on training exercises and goodwill visits 
to foreign ports. She saw only one major overseas deployment, to China in 1900
